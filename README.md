# StageFreight

> *Hello World's a Stage*

A declarative CI/CD automation CLI that detects, builds, scans, and releases container images across forges and registries — from a single manifest. StageFreight is open-source, self-building, and replaces fragile shell-script CI pipelines with a single Go binary driven by one [`.stagefreight.yml`](.stagefreight.yml) file.

### Features:

|                                |                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Detect → Plan → Build**      | Finds Dockerfiles, resolves tags from git, builds multi-platform images via `docker buildx`               |
| **Multi-Registry Push**        | Docker Hub, GHCR, GitLab, Quay, Harbor, JFrog, Gitea — with branch/tag filtering via regex (`!` negation) |
| **Security Scanning**          | Trivy vulnerability scan + Syft SBOM generation, configurable detail levels per branch or tag pattern      |
| **Cross-Forge Releases**       | Create releases on GitLab, GitHub, or Gitea with auto-generated notes, badges, and cross-platform sync    |
| **Cache-Aware Linting**        | 7 lint modules run in parallel, delta-only on changed files, with JUnit reporting for CI                  |
| **Retention Policies**         | Restic-style tag retention (keep_last, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly) across all registry providers       |
| **Self-Building**              | StageFreight builds itself — this image is produced by `stagefreight docker build`                        |

### Looking for a minimal image?

| Image | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| [`prplanit/stagefreight:0.1.1`](https://hub.docker.com/r/prplanit/stagefreight) | Last pre-CLI release — vanilla DevOps toolchain (bash, docker-cli, buildx, python3, yq, jq, etc.) |
| [`prplanit/ansible-oci`](https://hub.docker.com/r/prplanit/ansible-oci) | Ansible-native image — Python 3.13 + Alpine 3.22, ansible-core, ansible-lint, sops, rage, pywinrm, kubernetes.core, community.docker, community.sops |

Starting from **0.2.0**, `prplanit/stagefreight` includes the Go CLI binary and is purpose-built for `stagefreight docker build` workflows.
