# .stagefreight.yml — Microservices Monorepo
#
# Who: Teams with multiple distinct services in a single repository. Each
#      service has its own Dockerfile, its own image, its own tests — but
#      they share a codebase, a CI pipeline, and a release cycle.
# What: Multiple docker configs, each with their own Dockerfile path, target,
#       and registries. Distinct from multi-image (05) which uses ONE Dockerfile
#       with multiple stages — this uses MULTIPLE Dockerfiles.
# Build: Multiple Dockerfiles in subdirectories, each producing a separate image.
# Why: Monorepos are common. Each service should build, test, and push
#      independently while sharing the manifest.
