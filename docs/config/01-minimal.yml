#
# Who: Solo dev, hobby project, just wants the basics.
# What: Release notes generated from git log, badge SVG updated on release.
# Build: None — this might be a script repo, a config repo, or something
#        where the dev handles builds themselves.
# Why: 4 lines. Zero friction. Immediate value.
