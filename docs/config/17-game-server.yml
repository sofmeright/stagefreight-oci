# .stagefreight.yml — Game Server
#
# Who: Homelab users and small communities hosting game servers — Minecraft,
#      Valheim, Factorio, Palworld. Often forked from upstream server images
#      with custom mods, configs, or performance patches.
# What: Builds a customized game server image with mods baked in. Non-standard
#       ports, UDP healthchecks, volume mounts for world data.
# Build: Dockerfile extending upstream game server image with mods/configs.
# Why: Game servers are a huge homelab use case. The build is usually
#      "upstream image + mods folder + config tweaks" and nobody wants to
#      manually rebuild when the server or mods update.
