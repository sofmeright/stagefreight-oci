# .stagefreight.yml — Mirror Declaration
#
# Who: Any repo that is a read-only mirror of a source-of-truth elsewhere.
#      GitHub mirrors of GitLab repos, public mirrors of private repos, etc.
# What: Declares "I am a mirror." The daemon will never open MRs here,
#       never push code here, never treat this as a source. Git pushes
#       come from the source side via mirror rules in the daemon config.
# Build: None — mirrors don't build, the source does.
# Why: Prevents the daemon from accidentally treating a mirror as writable.
#      Badge stays current so the mirror looks alive.
