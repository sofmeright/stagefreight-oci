# .stagefreight.yml — Mirror Declaration
#
# Who: Any repo that is a read-only mirror of a source-of-truth elsewhere.
#      GitHub mirrors of GitLab repos, public mirrors of private repos, etc.
# What: Placeholder manifest. Currently serves as documentation — the presence
#       of this file signals "this repo is managed by StageFreight" even though
#       the mirror_of directive is not yet implemented. When the daemon lands,
#       this will tell StageFreight to never open MRs here, never push code
#       here, and never treat this as a source.
# Build: None — mirrors don't build, the source does.
# Why: Reserves a manifest slot so the repo isn't treated as unmanaged when
#      the daemon starts scanning. The daemon config (24) defines the actual
#      push rules on the source side.
